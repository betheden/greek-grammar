Case dative
===========

Glossary  
--------

**Dative** is a case which has a wide range of uses. It can indicate the *recipient*
or *reference* of a verbal action.  The dative case also is 
used to indicate the  *location, instrument, relation, or manner* in which 
something occurs.  Some verbs take their object in the dative case.


.. csv-table:: Example: Luke 24:42

  οἱ,δὲ,ἐπέδωκαν,**αὐτῷ**,ἰχθύος,ὀπτοῦ,μέρος
  hoi,de,epedōkan,**autō**,ichthyos,optou,meros
  They,and,they gave,**to him**,of a fish,broiled,part
  
*They gave* **him** *a piece of a broiled fish*

Article   
-------

The Dative case serves three primary functions. It may also indicate the direct object for some verbs

  1.  **Indirect object** or **personal interest** -  It serves as the case of personal interest by indicating the indirect object
      of the verb.  It points to whom something was done or for whom something was done. It can also be used to indicate someone or something that is being
      referred to by the verb, including possession.  [See  `Dative_Indirect Object <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_dative.html#dative-indirect-object-personal-interest>`_]
      
  2.  **location** - It may indicate the location (in place, sphere, or time) of an event. [See `Dative_location <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_dative.html#dative-locative-location>`_] 
  3.  **Instrumental** - It may indicate the means, cause, manner, agent of an action. [See `Dative_Instrumental <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_dative.html#dative-instrumental>`_]
  4.  **Direct object**-  Some verbs take their direct object in the dative case.  [See `Dative_Direct_Object <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_dative.html#dative-direct-object>`_]

*Note:* An indirect object is the person(s) or thing(s) toward which the verbal action of a verb or verb form is directed.

Form
~~~~
The Dative case is formed by adding the Dative case ending to the stem of a word (often with a connecting vowel).

[Note]
  *	The iota (ι) in the first and second singular declension will often subscript because it is a short vowel.
  *	The Nu (ν) in the third declension plural is a movable Nu and may or may not be present. The movabble Nu may be present 
  when it appears at the end of a sentence or when the following word begins with a vowel.  However, sometimes it appears  
  when the following word begins with a consonant.  There is no fixed rule that determines when a moveable Nu will be present.  
  The reader/translator must be aware that it may or may not be present.  [ For example there are early Greek manuscripts that
  include or exclude the moveable Nu for Acts 20:34 "καὶ τοῖς **οὖσι** μετ' ἐμοῦ  or καὶ τοῖς **οὖσιν** μετ' ἐμοῦ."


Dative – Indirect object /personal interest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Dative- Indirect object* will only occur with a transitive verb.   The noun or pronoun in the dative case receives the object 
of the verb. However, if the verb is passive, the word in the dative case will receive the subject of the verb.  This is the most
common use of the dative case when a preposition is not used.   Often, the translator will use the key words *“to”*  or *“for”* in the
translation. As an indirect object, the dative case is used to point out the person (or personification of something) *“to whom”* 
or *“for which”* something is done.  


.. csv-table::  Example: John 6:29
  
  ὁ,Ἰησοῦς,καὶ,εἶπεν,**αὐτοῖς**
  ho,Iēsous,kai,eipen,**autois**
  The,Jesus,and,he said,**to them**

*and Jesus said* **to them**,

.. csv-table::  Example: 2 Corinthians 12:7

  ἐδόθη,**μοι**,**σκόλοψ**,τῇ,σαρκί
  edothē,**moi**,**skolops**,tē,sarki
  it was given,**to me**,**thorn**,in the,flesh

a thorn in the flesh was given to me

Note:  in this example the verb ( ἐδόθη) is in the passive voice. Therefore, the word in the dative case receives the subject of
the clause (σκόλοψ) which is in the nominative case.  "τῃ σαρκί" is an example 
of `Dative_Locative<https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_dative.html#dative-locative-location>`_ which is described below.
	

Indirect Object of Advantage (or Disadvantage)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A sub-category of the Dative of Indirect Object is the *Indirect Object of Advantage* or (*Disadvantage*).  It may be to the advantage
(or disadvantage) of the person who receives the object.  If it is to the persons advantage, it is referred to as the *Indirect Object of*
*Advantage*.  If it is to their disadvantage (or harm), it is referred to as the *Indirect Object of Disadvantage.*

Example: Indirect Object of Advantage  

.. csv-table::  Example John 4:5

  πλησίον,τοῦ,χωρίου,ὃ,ἔδωκεν,Ἰακὼβ,**τῷ**,**Ἰωσὴφ**
  plēsion,tou,chōriou,ho,edōken,Iakōb,**tō**,**Iōsēph**
  near,the,land,that,he gave,Jacob,**to**,**Joseph**

*near the piece of land that Jacob had given* **to Joseph**

Example:  Indirect object of Disadvantage

.. csv-table::  Example:  1 Corinthians 11:29

  ὁ,γὰρ,ἐσθίων,καὶ,πίνων,κρίμα,**ἑαυτῷ**,ἐσθίει,καὶ,πίνει
  ho,gar,esthiōn,kai,pinōn,krima,**heautō**,esthiei,kai,pinei
  the,for,he who is eating,and,he who is drinking,judgment,**to himself**,he is eating,and,he is drinking

*For he who eats and drinks ..., eats and drinks judgment* **to himself.**


Dative of Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The Dative of Reference is a subcategory of the Indirect Object of Personal Interest.   Sometimes the meaning is better conveyed
   with a key word; “concerning”, “about”, “in regard to”, “with reference to”, or "in respect to”.  The Dative of Reference is often
   used when describing the effect of the action on a thing or a personification of something.

.. csv-table::  Example:  Romans 6:2

  οἵτινες,ἀπεθάνομεν,**τῇ**,**ἁμαρτίᾳ**,πῶς,ἔτι,ζήσομεν,ἐν,αὐτῇ?
  hoitines,apethanomen,**tē**,**hamartia**,pōs,eti,zēsomen,en,autē?
  We,we have died,**to**,**sin**,how,still,will we live,in,it

*We who died* **to sin**, *how can we still live in it?*

Note:  This verse could easily be translated  “With reference to sin, we have died.” or “in respect to sin”

See also:

.. csv-table::  Romans 6:11

  λογίζεσθε,ἑαυτοὺς,εἶναι,νεκροὺς,μὲν,**τῇ**,**ἁμαρτίᾳ**,ζῶντας,δὲ,**τῷ**,**Θεῷ**
  logizesthe,heautous,einai,nekrous,men,**tē**,**hamartia**,zōntas,de,**tō**,**Theō**
  You reckon,yourselves,to be,dead,on the one hand,**to**,**to sin**,alive,but,**to**,**to God**

*you also must consider yourselves to be dead* **to sin**, *but alive* **to God**.

Dative of Possession  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	
    Possession is a form of personal interest.  Therefore, the dative case, in some instances, is used to indicate possession.  
    Possession is generally indicated by use of the genitive case, but in some instances the dative case is used.  

.. csv-table::   Example:  Luke 1:7

  καὶ,οὐκ,ἦν,**αὐτοῖς**,τέκνον...
  kai,ouk,ēn,**autois**,teknon
  and,not,it/there was,**to them**,a child

*But they had no child*

  **Note:**  In this instance, our smooth translation drops the indirect object of possession.  
  It is awkward to say “And there was not to them a child.”  The sentence is entirely rephrased to result in a smooth translation.



Dative -Locative (location)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  *	Locative of place - The dative case may be used to indicate the location (or place) of an object in the physical world.  
  *	Locative of Sphere - When the place is more metaphorical or logical, it is referred to as the Locative of Sphere
  *	Locative of Time -  The dative case may also be used to indicate the location of an object in time.


Example for Locative of place (Note: the place is a physical location - "in a boat")

.. csv-table::   Example:  John 21:8

  οἱ,δὲ,ἄλλοι,μαθηταὶ,**τῷ**,**πλοιαρίῳ**,ἦλθον
  hoi,de,alloi,mathētai,**tō**,**ploiariō**,ēlthon
  the,but,other,disciples,**in**,**a boat**,they came

*The other disciples came* **in the boat**

Example for Locative of Sphere  (Note: the location is metaphorical or logical in nature)

.. csv-table::  Example:  Matthew 5:3

  μακάριοι,οἱ,πτωχοὶ,**τῷ**,**πνεύματι**
  makarioi,hoi,ptōchoi,**tō**,**pneumatic**
  Blessed,the,poor,**in**,**spirit**

*Blessed are the poor* **in spirit.**


Example for Locative of time

.. csv-table::  John 2:1

  καὶ,**τῇ**,**ἡμέρᾳ**,**τῇ**,**τρίτῃ**,γάμος,ἐγένετο,ἐν,Κανὰ
  kai,**tē**,**hēmera**,**tē**,**tritē**,gamos,egeneto,en,Kana
  and,**the**,**day**,**the**,**third**,a wedding,there was,in,Cana

*Three days later, there was a wedding in Cana*

Note:  In this instance  “**on the third day**” is translated “Three days later...”


Dative – Instrumental
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Dative-Instrumental* may be used to indicate the **Means, Cause, Manner, or Agent** by which an event occurs.  The *Dative-Instrumental* 
may also be used to indicate an association with the main subject of the action.  Making distinctions between Means, Cause, Manner, Agent,
or Association can be very difficult and often the choice between one category and another is a matter of personal interpretation.  

Instrumental of Means
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Instrumental of Means* is used to indicate the means (or the process or method) by which the action of the verb is accomplished.

.. csv-table::  Example:  Matthew 8:16

  καὶ,ἐξέβαλεν,τὰ,πνεύματα,**λόγῳ**
  kai,exebalen,ta,pneumata,**logo**
  and,he cast out,the,spirit,**with a word**

*He drove out the spirits* **with a word**

Instrumental of Cause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Instrumental of Cause* is used to indicate the cause, the motivating event, or reason something occurred.  Therefore, the key word
“because” may help in translation.

.. csv-table::  Example:  Romans 11:20

  **τῇ**,**ἀπιστίᾳ**,ἐξεκλάσθησαν
  **tē**,**apistia**,exeklasthēsan
  **because (of)**,**unbelief**,they were broken off

**Because of their unbelief** *they were broken off*


Instrumental of Manner 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Instrumental of Manner* is used to indicate the method or manner used to accomplish something.  This is very closely related 
to the *Instrumental of Means*. 


.. csv-table::  Example:  1 Corinthians 11:5

  πᾶσα,δὲ,γυνὴ,προσευχομένη,ἢ,προφητεύουσα,**ἀκατακαλύπτῳ**,**τῇ**,**κεφαλῇ**
  pasa,de,gynē,proseuchomenē,ē,prophēteuousa,**akatakalyptō**,**tē**,**kephalē**
  every,but,woman,who prays,or,who prophecies,**with uncovered**,**the**,**head**

*But every woman who prays or prophesies* **with her head uncovered**


Instrumental of Agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Instrumental of Agent* is used with a verb in the middle or passive voice to express the agent or person by which an action
is accomplished.  Agency may also be expressed by using the preposition ὑπὸ with the genitive case or δία with the accusative case. 


.. csv-table::  Example:  Galatians 5:18

  εἰ,δὲ,**Πνεύματι**,ἄγεσθε
  ei,de,**Pneumati**,agesthe
  if,but,**by Spirit**,you are led

*But if you are led* **by the Spirit**


Instrumental of Association
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Instrumental of Association* is used to indicate an association, relation, or affiliation of some kind with the subject carrying 
out the action of the verb.

.. csv-table::  Example:  Mark 2:15

  πολλοὶ,τελῶναι,καὶ,ἁμαρτωλοὶ,συνανέκειντο,**τῷ**,**Ἰησοῦ**,καὶ,**τοῖς**,**μαθηταῖς**,αὐτοῦ
  polloi,telōnai,kai,hamartōloi,synanekeinto,**tō**,**Iēsou**,kai,**tois**,**mathētais**,autou
  many,tax collectors,and,sinners,they were reclining at table,**with**,**Jesus**,and,**with**,**disciples**,of him
  
*many tax collectors and sinners were dining* **with Jesus** and **his disciples**  


Dative-Direct object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain verbs take their object in the dative case.  This often happens with verbs that indicate some sort of personal relation to the action.

The following is a list of 48 verbs that may take their object in the dative case:
