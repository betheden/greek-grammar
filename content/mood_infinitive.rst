Mood infinitive
===============

Glossary
--------

An **infinitive** is a verbal noun (e.g., *to eat*, *to run*, *to go*).
It expresses aspect and voice like other (finite) verbs, but does not
indicate person or number. It can take an object, but usually does not
explicitly express a subject.

οὓς οὐκ ἔξεστιν **φαγεῖν** εἰ μὴ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν, (Mrk 2:26)

it is not lawful for anyone **to eat** except the priests
