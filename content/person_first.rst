Person first
============

Glossary
--------

**First person** is a grammatical feature indicating that the speaker is the subject of the verbal action or is speaking about themselves (e.g.,
*I ran*, *we ran*).

Article
-------
`
The first person is the person or persons that are speaking. If it is a single person, it is “I”, “me”, or “my”, if it is a group of people it is “we”, “us”, or “our”.

The first person can be found in [Verb](https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/verb.html) forms, and [Pronoun_Personal](https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pronoun_personal.html) forms.

**Note**
The first person is only used in direct speech.

Form
^^^^
When a word is in the first person, it can be recognized by a variety of changes to the form. These changes differ greatly from each other and are hard to sum up in a simple, helpful way.  These changes can be classified into Verbal Conjugation forms and Personal Pronouns.


Some languages use an inclusive we (which includes the person being spoken to in the “we”) and an exclusive we (which excludes the person being spoken to from the “we”).  Neither English nor Biblical Greek distinguishes between the inclusive and the exclusive “we”. The context will determine which one is meant. See also  [translationAcademy](http://ufw.io/academy/) and [translationNotes](http://unfoldingword.org/tn/) for help if the context is not clear.


Greek distinguishs between [Number Singular](https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/number_singular.html) and [Number Plural](https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/number_plural.html), but not between [Gender Masculine](https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gender_masculine.html) and [Gender Feminine](https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gender_feminine.html) or [Gender Neuter](https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gender_neuter.html) or  in the first person.


The first person can be found in [Verb](https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/verb.html) forms and as a [Pronoun](https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pronoun.html).

The first person of a verb is formed by adding a first person personal ending (or sufformative) to the verb stem.  These endings can be divided into eight basict types: primary active, secondary active, primary middle/passive, and secondary middle/passive.  The  present tense uses the primary endings.  The aorist tense uses the secondary endings.There are also singular and plural endings.  

The paradigm below shows a sample of the kinds of changes that signal a first person.

Greek distinguishes between  [Number Singular](https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/number_singular.html) and

## Function
### Verb Forms

A first person can be used  in a sentence (or a clause) as the subject, an object, or to indicate possession. Personal pronouns may 
also be the object of a preposition.  The number (singular or plural) will agree with its antecedent.  However, the case will depend on 
its function in the sentence (or clause).


###### Subject
The subject in a sentence is usually the person or thing which does the action of the verb.  However, if the verb is in the passive voice, the subject receives the action of the verb.


John 3:11


ἀμὴν	ἀμὴν	λέγω	σοι	ὅτι	ὃ	οἴδαμεν	λαλοῦμεν	καὶ	ὃ	ἑωράκαμεν	μαρτυροῦμεν
amēn	amēn	legō	soi	hoti	ho	oidamen	laloumen	kai	ho	heōrakamen	martyroumen
Truly	truly	I say	to you	that	what	we know	we are speaking	and	what	we have seen	we are testifying
Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak what we know, and we testify about what we have seen.


The personal ending of the verb is generally sufficient to show the person and number of the subject of the sentence.  Therefore an emphasis is being made when the nominative case of the personal pronoun is used in conjunction with the verb.



John 14:6
ἐγώ	εἰμι	ἡ	ὁδὸς	καὶ	ἡ	ἀλήθεια	καὶ	ἡ	ζωή
									
egō	eimi	hē	hodos	kai	hē	alētheia	kai	hē	zōē
									
I	am	the	way	and	the	truth	and	the	life
									
I am the way and the truth and the life.

 
 
εἰμί is a first person singular present active indicative verb and indicates the number and subject of the sentence.  Therefore the addition of the personal pronoun <b>ἐγώ</b>  places a slight emphasis on the pronoun.

## As a [Pronoun Personal](https://uhg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pronoun_personal.html#pronoun-personal)

The personal pronoun can be used in all cases.

### Prepositions

First person personal pronouns can be the object of a preposition.  They therefore can occur in the Genitive, Dative, or Accusative case depending upon the preposition.


<table>
<caption><b>First person personal pronoun- preposition</b></caption>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">John 6:44</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>οὐδεὶς</td><td>	δύναται</td><td>ἐλθεῖν</td><td>	πρός</td><th>με</th><td>ἐὰν</td><td>μὴ</td><td>ὁ</td><td>Πατὴρ</td><td>ὁ</td><td>πέμψας</td><td>με</td><td>ἑλκύσῃ</td><td>αὐτόν</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>oudeis</td><td>dynatai</td><td>elthein</td><td>pros</td><th>me</th><td>ean</td><td>mē</td><td>ho</td><td>Patēr</td><td>ho</td><td>pempsas</td><td>me</td><td>helkysē</td><td>auton</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>no one</td><td>is able</td><td>to come</td><td>	to</td><th>me</th><td>if</td><td>not</td><td>the</td><td>father</td><td>who sent</td><td>me</td><td>draws</td><td>him</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="14">No one can come to <b>me</b> unless the Father who sent me draws him,…</td>
</tr>
</table>



### Subject of a sentence or clause (including predicate nominative)


<table>
<caption><b>First person personal pronoun- nominative case</b>  ἐγώ, ἠμεῖς</caption> 
<tr> <td colspan="5">2 Corinthians	4:13</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ἡμεῖς</th><td>	πιστεύομεν</td><td>	διὸ</td><td>	καὶ</td><td>	λαλοῦμεν</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>hēmeis</th><td>	pisteuomen</td><td>	dio</td><td>kai</td><td>laloumen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>We</th><td>	we believe</td><td>	therefore</td><td>	also</td><td>	we speak</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="5"><b>We</b>  believe, and so we also speak.</td>
</tr></table>


The personal ending of the verb is generally sufficient to show the person and number of the subject of the sentence.  Therefore an emphasis is being made when the nominative case of the personal pronoun is used in conjunction with the verb.


## Possession


<table>
<tr>
<td colspan="5"><b>First Person personal pronoun – Genitive case</b>  
ἐμοῦ, μοῦ, ἡμῶν</td>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">Mark 1:11</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>σὺ</td><td>	εἶ</td><td>	ὁ</td><td> Υἱός</td><th>μου</th><td>ὁ</td><td colspan="2">ἀγαπητός</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sy</td><td>	ei</td><td>	ho</td><td>	Huios</td><th>mou</th><td>	ho</td><td colspan="2">	agapētos</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>you</td><td>are</td><td>the</td><td>son</td><th>my</th><td>	the</td><td colspan="2">beloved</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="7">You are<b> my</b> beloved Son.</td>
</tr>
</table>
Note: Some prepositions take their object in the Genitive case.



## Objective Cases


The object in a sentence is the person (or object) that receives the direct (or indirect) action of the verb.  This is done by adding an object in either the dative or the accusative case.

### Dative 

<table>
<caption><b>First person personal pronoun- dative case</b>  έμοί, μοί, ἡμῖν</caption>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"> John	2:18</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>τί</td><td>	σημεῖον</td><td>δεικνύεις</td><th>	ἡμῖν</th><td>	ὅτι</td><td>ταῦτα</td><td>	ποιεῖς</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ti</td><td>	sēmeion</td><td>deiknyeis</td><th>	hēmin</th><td>	hoti</td><td>tauta</td><td>	poieis</td>

<tr>
<td>What</td><td>sign</td><td>do you show</td><th>to us</th><td>because</td><td>these things</td><td>you do</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="7"> "What sign will you show <b>us</b>, since you are doing these things?</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Accusative

<table>
<td colspan="4"><b>First person personal pronoun- accusative case</b></d>
<tr><td colspan="2">Mark 9:19</td>

<tr>
<td>φέρετε</td><td>	αὐτὸν</td><td>	πρός</td><th>	με</th>

<tr>
<td colspan="4">Bring him to<b> me</b>.</td>

## Reflexive use of the first person personal pronoun 
###     ἐμαυτοῦ, ἐμαυτῷ, ἐμαυτόν   or   αὐτός, αὐτοῦ, αὐτῷ, αὐτοί, αὐτοίς

The first person reflexive personal pronoun ἐμαυτοῦ occurs 37 times in the New Testament in the Genetive, Dative and Accusative cases but occurs only in the masculine singular form.

αὐτός is used as a first person reflexive pronoun 22 times in the New Testament.  It occurs in both the singular and plural forms.

One time (at 2 Corinthians 1:9) in the New Testament the third person reflexive personal pronoun ἑαυτοῖς is used as a first person reflexive personal pronoun.



John 12:32
<table>
