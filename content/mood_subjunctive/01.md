# mood_subjunctive Glossary
The **subjunctive mood** indicates that the speaker is referring to the verbal action as a possibility (e.g., *he may eat*, *he should eat*, *he could eat*, *let's eat*).

ποῦ ἐστιν τὸ κατάλυμά μου ὅπου τὸ πάσχα μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν μου **φάγω**; (Mrk 14:14)

Where is the guest room where **I may eat** the Passover with my disciples?
