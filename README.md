# English Unlocked Greek Grammar

This is the repository for a reference grammar for biblical Greek based on the [parsing codes](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en_ugg/src/master/parsingscheme_updated.pdf) that show up in the [Bunning Heuristic Prototype](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en_ugg/src/master/BHP20170517.xlsx) of the UGNT.

Documentation for the Unlocked Grammar projects can be found here: http://ug-info.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Roadmap

### First stage

* Reference Grammar with examples as in teaching grammars
* 1-2 sentence that is pop-upable (with “view more”)
* ~1 page for each entry

#### Phase 1 

* Create glossary entries for each grammatical concept specified

#### Phase 2

* Create article entries for each grammatical concept specified

### Second stage

* Tag the UGNT with specific grammatical information (e.g., possessive genitive)

### Third stage

* Write syntax articles
* Tag text with syntax information
