# English Unlocked Greek Grammar

This is the repository for a reference grammar for biblical Greek based on the [morphology codes](https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/Nestle1904/blob/master/parsing.txt) that show up in the [Nestle 1904 text](https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/Nestle1904).

## Roadmap

### First stage

* Start fresh and provide descriptions of grammatical concepts that show up in [Nestle 1904 text](https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/Nestle1904) morphological data
* Reference Grammar with examples as in teaching grammars
* 1-2 sentence that is pop-upable (with “view more”)
* ~1 page for each entry

### Second stage

* Tag the UGNT with specific grammatical information (possessive genitive)

### Third stage

* Write syntax articles
* Tag text with syntax information
