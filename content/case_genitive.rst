Case genitive
=============

Glossary  [DRAFT - IN PROCESS]
--------

**Genitive** is a case which has many uses. It expresses a relationship with the substantive it modifies by indicating a
*description*, *kinship*, *possession*, *apposition*, *a part of a whole*, *separation from the substantive it modifies*, 
*or the subject  (or object) of a verbal idea implied by the noun*.

  John 1:19
  καὶ,αὕτη,ἐστὶν,ἡ,μαρτυρία,**τοῦ**,**Ἰωάννου**
  kai,hautē,estin,hē,martyria,**tou**,**Iōannou**
  and,this,it is,the,testimony,**of**,**the**,**John**


*This is the testimony* **of John**  ; or
 *This is* **John’s** *testimony*

In this example, the relationship expressed is that of possession.



Article   [DRAFT - IN PROCESS]
-------

The **Genitive case** is primarily the case of description.  

  1. The Genitive case may be used to attribute   
  
      * a basic quality to the noun, or [see `Genitive-Attribute<https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_genitive.html#genitive-separation-or-source>`_
      *	of material from which it was formed or contains.  [see `Genitive_Material<https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_genitive.html#genitive-of-material>`_
      
  2. The Genitive case may also express a relationship to the subject noun (or substantive) 
      
      *	of kinship, [see `Genitive_Kinship<https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_genitive.html#genitive-of-kinship>`_
      * possession, [see `Genitive_Possession<https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_genitive.html#genitive-of-possession>`_
      * apposition, or [see `Genitive_Apposition<https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_genitive.html#genitive-of-apposition>`_
      * separation (or source).[see `Genitive_Separation<https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_genitive.html#genitive-separation-or-source.`_
      
  3. A word in the genitive case may also serve as the subject or object of the head noun. [see `Genitive_Subject/Object<https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_genitive.html#genitive-subject-object>`_

The translator may observe that sometimes a specific word in the Genitive case may seem to fit into more than one of the above categories.
There is often no clear single category and the final determination by the translator must be based upon context.

Form
~~~~
The Genitive case is formed by adding the *Genitive case ending* to the stem of a word (often with a connecting vowel).  
The word in the Genitive case usually follows the word that it is modifying.

See `NounParadigm <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paradigms.html#nouns>`_  for a complete listing of the noun paradigms and 
`AdjectiveParadigm <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paradigms.html#adjectives>`_ for the adjective paradigms.


Genitive – Attributive
######################

The Genitive case restricts (or limits) the head noun (or substantive) by describing the head noun.  The limitation is generally 
as to “kind” and not to “extent or result.”   The effect of the description is that it separates the head noun from other similar 
items that do not possess the described attribute.  For example if I were to say a “book of the law;”  the phrase *"of the law”* 
describes the book. The phrase also separates this book from all the other books which are not law books.  

The **Genitive-attributive** functions like an adjective and gives a general attribute (or description) of the head noun.  
If none of the other categories for the Genitive case make sense, then this overall “Basic Attributive” serves to describe 
the overall function for the Genitive case.    

The keyword “**of**” is often included in the translation.

  ἐγένετο,Ἰωάννης,...,κηρύσσων,βάπτισμα,**μετανοίας**,εἰς,ἄφεσιν,ἁμαρτιῶν
  egeneto,Iōannēs,...,kēryssōn,baptisma,**metanoias**,eis,aphesin,hamartiōn
  he came,John,,preaching,a baptism,**of repentance**,into/for,forgiveness,of sin
  
*John came, ... preaching a baptism* **of repentance** *for the forgiveness of sins.*

Genitive – of Material
######################

The **Genitive of Material** describes an object that is *“made from, consisting of, or containing”* something.  
The Genitive of Material may be used to:

  #.  describe an object “made from a certain material or thing”, or  
  #.  may be used to describe something the object “contains”.   

In this instance the *item (or thing) that is used to create the object* or *that the object contains* will be in the Genitive case.   

.. csv-table::

  Acts 2:4
  καὶ,ἐπλήσθησαν,πάντες,**Πνεύματος**,Ἁγίου
  kai,eplēsthēsan,pantes,**Pneumatos**,Hagiou
  and,they,were,filled,all,**with Spirit**,Holy

*They were all filled* **with** *the Holy* **Spirit**

Note:   The preposition *with* is used because it better conveys the concept of the "content an object contains."
If the translator interpreted this passage as a Genitive of separation- they would use the preposition "from" or  the Genitive of source,
they would use the preposition "by".   These determinations are being made based on context in order to accurately convey the concept
intended by the text.

Genitive – of Kinship
#####################

The Genitive Case may be used to describe a kinship relationship.  In most cases The Genitive of Kinship is used to describe 
someone who is the physical descendent (son or daughter) of someone.  However, it can be used to refer to anyone who is a descendent 
in a “spiritual sense” or  someone who is a descendent several generations removed.  Therefore in Luke 13:16  the woman is called a 
daughter of Abraham even though over a thousand years had passed.  The woman is still considered to be a daughter of Abraham.  
The Genitive of Kinship may also be used to describe the parent of someone or a relationship by marriage to someone.

*Note:* Some grammars make a distinction between when the noun that would describe the kinship relationship (“Son”) is present and 
when it is omitted.  In this grammar we are not making that fine of a distinction.  When the noun that describes the kinship relationship
is absent, the “kinship relationship”  is implied by the Genitive of Kinship.  The definite article may (or may not) be present.
This implied relationship is then included in the translation.   

The key word “of” may be used in the translation.

.. csv-table::

  Matthew 4:21
  Ἰάκωβον,τὸν,,**τοῦ**,**Ζεβεδαίου**
  Iakōbon,ton,,**tou**,Zebedaiou
  James,the,(son),**of**,**Zebedee**

*James the* **son of Zebedee**	

In the following example the “kinship relationship” (mother of) is implied by the Genitive of Kinship.

.. csv-table::

  Luke 24:10
  καὶ,Μαρία,ἡ,,**Ἰακώβου**
  kai,Maria,hē,,**Iakōbou**
  and,Mary,the,**(mother of)**,**James**

*and Mary the* **mother of James**

Genitive – of Possession
########################


The Genitive of Possession us used to indicate ownership or possession of an object that it is modifying.
The ownership may be an indication of a legal right to ownership or physical possession of an item.  

It may also refer to an emotional attachment to the object.  In this instance the ownership is like that of a child to his father, 
a dog to his master, or a person to his church.  This is my father. This is my master. This is my church.  In each of these cases
an emotional attachment is being expressed.

The Genitive of Possession is often used with a possessive pronoun such as *μου, ἡμῶν, σοῦ, ὑμῶν.*

  John 20:28
  ἀπεκρίθη,Θωμᾶς,καὶ,εἶπεν,αὐτῷ,ὁ,Κύριός,**μου**,καὶ,ὁ,Θεός,**μου!**
  apekrithē,Thōmas,kai,eipen,autō,ho,Kyrios,**mou**,kai,ho,Theos,**mou!**
  he answered,Thomas,and,he said,to him,the,Lord,**my**,and,the,God,**my**

*Thomas answered and said to him,* “**My** *Lord and* **my** *God.”*


Genitive of Apposition
######################

Apposition means *“next to”* or *“beside.”*  Sometimes a second noun is placed next to a noun to add additional information 
(to further describe the head noun). The noun in apposition  may be in the nominative case (Nominative-Apposition) or may be 
in the Genitive case (Genitive of Apposition).  A word is probably standing in apposition to another noun if the translator could 
use the phrase  “who is ..., or which is ... , or namely...” followed by the noun in apposition. In the example below, “his mother” 
is in apposition to Mary.   The phrase could be translated “They saw the young child with Mary (who is his mother).  

.. csv-table::

  Matthew 2:11
  εἶδον,τὸ,παιδίον,μετὰ,Μαρίας,**τῆς**,**μητρὸς**,αὐτοῦ
  eidon,to,paidion,meta,Marias,**tēs**,**mētros**,autou
  they saw,the,child,with,Mary,**the**,**mother**,of him.

*They saw the young child with* **Mary his mother**. 



Genitive – Separation (or Source)
#################################

The Genitive Case may be used to indicate separation from or the source of an object. Therefore, the prepositions *έκ* and *ἀπό* 
naturally take their object in the Genitive case.

Some grammars describe eight cases and refer to this usage as “Ablative case.”  There is no difference in form for a word in the 
Genitive Case and a word in the Ablative Case.  Both terms ( the Genitive – Separation and  Ablative) case refer to the same function 
indicating separation, or source.  The Genitive Case may also be used for comparison, because a comparison of two objects indicates a 
separation of the two objects.

  ὅτι,ἐστὲ,ἐπιστολὴ,**Χριστοῦ**

  the,half,of my,**of**,**possessions/goods**,Lord,to the,poor,I give

*Lord, the half of my* **goods** *I give to the poor*

Note: In this example  “of goods” is a Genitive of Source.   “My” is a Genitive of possession.

  not,he is,a slave,greater,**than**,**lord**,his

*a servant is not greater* **than his master**
Note:  In this example we see the comparative function for the Genitive of Separation.
  
Genitive – Subject/Object
#########################

A word in the genitive case may also serve as the subject or object of the head noun.  This can occur when the head noun contains a 
verbal idea such as witness, love, or hope.  

Some verbs that involve the senses (ἀκούω), feelings (ἐπιύμέω), memory (μνημονεὐω), and 
verbs prefixed with ἀπό, ἐκ, or κατά will take their object in the Genitive case.


.. csv-table::

  Matthew 24:27
  οὕτως,ἔσται,ἡ,παρουσία,**τοῦ**,**Υἱοῦ**,τοῦ,Ἀνθρώπου
  houtōs,estai,hē,parousia,**tou**,**Huiou**,tou,Anthrōpou
  thus,it will be,the,coming,**of the**,**Son**,of,Man

*so will be the coming* **of the Son** *of Man*

[In this example, the word  παρουσία (or coming) contains a verbal idea.  The subject of this verbal idea is τοῦ Υἱοῦ.   
It is referring to the Son’s coming.  The writer could have said, “The son will come just like..”]

.. csv-table::

  1 Corinthians 1:6
  καθὼς,τὸ,μαρτύριον,**τοῦ**,**Χριστοῦ**,ἐβεβαιώθη,ἐν,ὑμῖν
  kathōs,to,martyrion,**tou**,**Christou**,ebebaiōthē,en,hymin
  just as,the,testimony,**of**,**Christ**,has been confirmed,in,you

*just as the testimony* **about Christ** *has been confirmed as true among you*

Note:  In this case “Christ” is the recipient of the testimony.  Therefore the smooth translation uses the term “about Christ.”
