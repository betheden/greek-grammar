# determiner_article 
Determiners are words that identify or quantify a noun.   The definite article quantifies the noun by making it distinct from others of its kind.      [e.g. *the* book as opposed to any book].  The absence of the definite article stresses the basic quality or character of the object as opposed to any particular object.
