# adjective Article

An adjective describes, or modifies, a noun or a pronoun.  An adjective may give more information about a noun, or it may define which noun the writer is talking about.  

## Form

Greek adjectives must match the noun they modify in **case**, **number**, and **gender**.  Because of this, they can take the form of all three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.  (When listed in a lexicon, the adjective will be in its nominative, singular, masculine form.)   Adjectives will show these forms by using the same endings as nouns.  (The set of suffixes used by each adjective is determined by its stem, just as is true with nouns.  The paradigm below shows one of the most common sets of adjective endings, but some adjectives will use other suffixes.)

If an adjective is functioning as a **substantive** (see below), its case will be determined by its function within the sentence, and its number and gender will be determined by the noun it represents.

Note that the adjective's feminine form depends on its own stem, not on the noun it is modifying.  (For example, an adjective that takes η (eta) feminine endings will do so even when modifying a noun that has α (alpha) endings, and vice versa.)  As long as the adjective agrees with its noun in case, number, and gender, the specific form of its endings makes no difference to translation. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>τῆς δικαίας τῆς ἀναστροφῆς</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>tēs dikaias tēs anastrophēs</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the righteous the conduct-of</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>of the righteous conduct</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If a noun declines using suffixes that do not match its true gender, the adjective, like the article, will take the form that represents the true gender of the noun.  

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>τούς ἀγαθούς τούς προφήτας</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>tous agathous tous prophētas</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the good the prophet</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the good prophet</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In this example, the word προφήτας appears feminine, but is actually masculine.  The adjective takes a masculine form to match the true gender of the noun.  

## Function

### Attributive and Restrictive

If the adjective is giving more information about its noun, it is functioning as an **attributive** adjective.  If it is identifying which noun the writer is speaking about, it is functioning as a **restrictive** adjective.   An adjective functioning as attributive or restrictive may come before or after the noun it modifies.  It will usually have an article.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ὁ πιστός ὁ οἰκονόμος</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ho pisto ho oikonomos</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the faithful the steward</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the faithful steward</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ὁ οἰκονόμος ὁ πιστός</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ho oikonomos ho pistos</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the steward the faithful</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the faithful steward</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Predicative

If an adjective does not have an article, but the modified noun does have an article, the adjective is probably functioning as a **predicate**, which completes a statement about the noun by following a being or sensing verb, or a verb that explains the noun's appearance.  In this type of construct, the Greek sometimes leaves out the verb.  The verb is understood, but not stated.  Some languages need a verb in every sentence, so the understood verb may be added to the translation in order to make the sentence grammatically correct in the new language.   

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>πιστός ὁ οἰκονόμος</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pistos ho oikonomos</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>faithful the steward </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The steward is faithful.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Substantive

Sometimes, an adjective is used without any noun that it could be modifying, so the adjective functions as a noun by itself.   In this case, the reader understands that the writer is referring to some unnamed person or object, but the adjective is the only identifying term given to the person or object.  An adjective functioning in this way is called a **substantive** (because the substance of a noun is implied by the adjective).  A substantive adjective will usually have an article.  

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ὁ πιστός</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ho pistos  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the faithful </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the faithful man/person</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ἡ πιστή</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hē pistē</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the faithful </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the faithful woman/person</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>οἱ πιστοι</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hoi pistoi</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the faithful </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the faithful people/ones</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Comparative 

When an adjective is used to compare its noun to another noun, it is functioning as a **comparative** adjective.  Comparatives are formed by adding -τερος (masc.), -τερα (fem.), or -τερον (neut.) to the end of the adjective.  (Some irregular adjectives take the suffixes -(ι)ων or -ον instead.)

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>τό ἐλαχιστότερον τό θηρίον</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>to elachistoteron to thērion</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the smaller the animal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the smaller animal</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Superlative and Elative

An adjective that compares a noun to two or more other nouns is a **superlative** adjective.  The suffixes that show the superlative form are -τατος (m.), -τατη (f.), and -τατον (n.) or -ιστος (m.), -ιστη (f.), and -ιστον (n.).  (In some instances, ancient Greeks would use the superlative form of an adjective to compare two things, rather than to express a true superlative quality.  Adjectives used in this way are called **elative**.)  

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>τό ἐλάχιστον τό τέκνον</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>to elachiston to teknon</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the smallest the child</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the smallest child</td>
  </tr>
</table>
