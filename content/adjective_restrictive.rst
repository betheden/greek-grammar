Adjective restrictive
=====================

Glossary
--------

For the Unlocked Greek Grammar, Restrictive Adjectives are adjectives that are NOT classified as a noun, and 
DO follow the pattern **Article-Noun-Article-Adjective**.



Article
-------

Adjectives occur in five basic patterns when modifying a noun:
  #. Article-noun-article-adjective
  #. Article-adjective-noun
  #. Article-noun-adjective
  #. Adjective-noun
  #. Noun-adjective

Pattern 1 is classified as Restrictive in the Unlocked Greek Grammar and the 
`Unfolding_Word_Greek_New_Testament`Unfolding_Word_Greek_New_Testament <https://klappy.github.io/translation-helps/?owner=door43-catalog&rc=/en/ult/>`_.

Patterns 2, 3, 4, and 5, are classified as ascriptive in the Unlocked Greek Grammar and the Unfolding Word Greek New Testament.


INCORRECT DEFINITION OF RESTRICTIVE ADJECTIVE **FOR UNLOCKED GREEK GRAMMAR**
Some resources will describe an adjectival clause as restrictive if it narrows down (or identifies) the noun it is modifying.
In other words it directs the reader to a specific person or thing (or persons or things) from a larger group.   
In contrast an ascriptive adjective provides additional information about a person or thing that has already been clearly identified. 
For the purposes of the Unlocked Greek Grammar, the terms “ascriptive” and “restrictive” are NOT being used in this manner.
Restrictive adjectives are adjectives that are not functioning as a noun and follow the pattern [Article-Noun-Article-Adjective].
