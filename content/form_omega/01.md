# form_omega Glossary
The Greek verb takes prefixes and suffixes according to predetermined patterns. "Omega" refers to the person-number suffix of the present active indicative first person singular form (λύω, "I loose"). This pattern anticipates the pattern associated throughout the omega type verb. A student who knows this pattern may identify or anticipate other verbs of this type. For example, the Present Active Indicative of λύω is:


|          | Singular | Transl.        | Plural   | Transl.   |
| -------- | -------- | --------       | -------- | --------  |
| 1st      | λύω      | I loose        | λύομεν   | We loose  |
| 2nd      | λύεις    | You loose      | λύετε    | You loose |
| 3rd      | λύει     |He/she/it looses| λύουσι(ν)| They loose|
