Glossary
--------

**Tense** is a form of a verb which indicates the speaker's perspective
or viewpoint of the *time of action* and the *kind of action* of the
verb.

The *time of action* can be *past*, *present* or *future*. The *kind of
action* can be *mere occurrence*, *duration* or *completion*.

Greek has 10 \* forms\*:

1.  **present tense** generally refers to present time and durative
    action
2.  **imperfect tense** generally refers to past time and durative
    action
3.  **aorist tense** generally refers to past time and mere occurrence
4.  **2nd aorist** is different in form but has the same meaning as
    *aorist*
5.  **perfect tense** generally refers to past time and completed action
6.  **2nd perfect** is different in form but has the same meaning as
    *perfect*
7.  **pluperfect tense** generally refers to (more remote) past time and
    completed action
8.  **2nd pluperfect** is different in form but has the same meaning as
    *pluperfect*
9.  **future tense** refers to future time and any of the kinds of
    action
10. **2nd future** is different in from but has the same meaning as
    *future*

Older Greek grammars often refer to **tense** while some newer grammars
call this \*\* form\*\* in order to emphasis *verbal aspect*. A modern
approach is to refer to the *form* (or morphological encoding) as
**tense form**, while referring to the concept of the *viewpoint of the
action * as *aspect.*
