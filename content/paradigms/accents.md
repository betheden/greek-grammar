**Rules for Accents**

1) The **acute** accent (´) can be used on any of the last three syllables of a word.

2) The **circumflex** accent (῀) can be used only on one of the last two syllables of a word, and will always occur on a long vowel.

3) The **grave** accent (`) only occurs on the final syllable of a word. It occurs where an acute accent on the final syllable (ultima) is not followed by a punctuation mark.

4) Accents on nouns attempt to stay on the same syllable; Accents on verbs attempt to move as close to the beginning of the word as possible.
