Glossary
--------

A **verb** is a word used to describe an action, event or state of
affairs (e.g., *eat*, *teach*, *preach*). It is the main part of the
predicate of a sentence.

-------

As stated in the Glossary, A verb is a word used to describe an action, event, or state of affairs.

The action of the verb may require an object to complete the action of the verb.  Verbs that require an object to complete the action
are **Transitive verbs.** [See :ref:`Transative_Verb<verb_transitive>` ]  Verbs that do not require an object to complete the action are
**Intransative verbs**. [See :ref:`Intransative_Verb<verb_intransitive>` ]  A few verbs can be used as both a transitive verb and
an intransitive verb.

A :ref:`Linking_Verb<verb_linking>`  does not express an action but connects the subject of the verb to additional information
in the predicate.

Verbs are made up of six basic components:

  *	The **root** which carries the basic meaning of the verb. 
  *	The **tense** which indicates the speaker’s perspective or viewpoint *of the time of action* and the *kind of action* of the verb. The kind of action may be *continuous*, *completed*, or *completed with an ongoing effect.*
  
  *	The **voice**  which indicates whether the subject performs the action (active voice), whether the action is performed on the subject (passive voice), or that the subject does the action of the verb but somehow is also affected by the action of the verb 
  or participating in the action of the verb (middle voice).  Many verbs are said to be deponent.  A deponent verb is a verb whose stem is middle or passive in form, but active in meaning.   The definitions of many verbs that are classified as deponent have a meaning
  that implies the participation of the person doing the action.

  *	The **mood** which indicates the speaker’s viewpoint of the verbal action in relation to reality. Greek has four moods: indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and optative.
  *	**Number** which signifies whether one (singular) or more (plural) participants are indicated by a word.
  *	**Gender** which indicates if the subject of the verb is masculine, feminine, or neuter.

Verbs must agree with the subject of the verb in both number and gender.  Therefore, the pronoun (he, she, or it) is included in the verb itself and is not necessary to be restated as a separate word. 
Parts (or components)

Verbs are made up of :
  1.	The root is the most basic part of a word.  The root conveys the basic meaning of the word.  The root may be modified to make the word a noun, an adjective, a verb, or to indicate the tense of the verb.   
  2.	The stem is the form of the root in a particular verbal tense. For some verbs, the present tense stem is identical to the root, but this is not always the case.  
  3.	Prefix -  A prefix may be added to the stem of a verb to change its tense or the meaning of the root.
  4.	Suffixes and connecting vowels (and sometimes with a prefix) are added to the end of the stem to change the person, number, tense, mood, or voice of a verb.
 5.	Connecting vowels are often added before the suffix to aid in pronunciation, but may also be used to change the mood of the verb.
