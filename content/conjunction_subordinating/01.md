# conjunction_subordinating Glossary
A subordinating conjunjunction is a conjunction that combines an independent clause with a dependent clause.
A dependent clause cannot stand on its own. [exampe:  The boy received a present **because** it was his birthday.]
Typical subordinating conjunctions are **since**, **because**, **before**, and **until**.
