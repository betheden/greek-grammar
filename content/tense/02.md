The *time of action* can be *past*, *present* or *future*. The *kind of action* can be *mere occurrence*, *duration* or *completion*. 

Greek has 10 *tense forms*:

1. **present tense** generally refers to present time and durative action
1. **imperfect tense** generally refers to past time and durative action
1. **aorist tense** generally refers to past time and mere occurrence
1. **2nd aorist** is different in form but has the same meaning as *aorist*
1. **perfect tense** generally refers to past time and completed action
1. **2nd perfect** is different in form but has the same meaning as *perfect*
1. **pluperfect tense** generally refers to (more remote) past time and completed action
1. **2nd pluperfect** is different in form but has the same meaning as *pluperfect*
1. **future tense** refers to future time and any of the kinds of action
1. **2nd future** is different in from but has the same meaning as *future*

Older Greek grammars often refer to **tense** while some newer grammars call this **tense form** in order to emphasis *verbal aspect*. A modern approach is to refer to the *form* (or morphological encoding) as **tense form**, while referring to the concept of the *viewpoint of the action * as *aspect.*
