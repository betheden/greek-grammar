Case
====

Glossary
--------

The Greek language uses a system called **Case**  to indicate the function or relationship of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, articles,
and participles to other words in the sentence.  Case endings (or suffixes) are added to the end of the noun, pronoun, adjective,
article, or participle to indicate its function or relationship to the other words in the sentence.  There are five cases in the Greek
language;  Nominative, Vocative, Genitive, Dative, and Accusative.

Languages such as Greek, Japanese, German, and Russian also have a case system.   English for the most part does not use a case system
except for pronouns.  Instead English mostly uses word order to indicate the function of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives within the
sentence.  In the example below the first person singular pronoun changes depending on its function in the sentence.

  Subject case,,**I** am speaking
  Possessive case,,It is **My** ball
  Object case,,The ball hit **me**.
    
Other languages, such as Hebrew, do not use a case system.

The **Nominative Case** is used to indicate the subject of the sentence, but it can also can indicate a  predicate nominative,
and can be used to indicate apposition.  It is also used for adjectives and participles modifying the subject of the sentence.
See :ref:`Nominative case<case_nominative>` for more detail.

The **Vocative case** is the case of Direct Address.  See :ref:`Vocative Case<case_vocative>` for more detail.

The **Genitive case** indicates possession, but can also be used to indicate separation or relation.  In limited situations, it can also
can indicate the subject or an object of the verb in the sentence among other uses.  Adjectives and participles modifying an object in the
genitive case will also be in the Genitive. Some prepositions take their object in the genitive.  See :ref:`Genitive case<case_genitive>` for more details.

The **Dative case** is used to indicate, location, means, agency, or the indirect object.  Adjectives and participles modifying an object
in the Dative case will also be in the dative.  Some prepositions take their object in the dative.  See :ref:`Dative Case<case_dative>` for more details.

The **Accusative case** is the case for the Direct Object among other uses.  Adjectives and participles modifying a object in the accusative
case will also be in the accusative.  Some prepositions take their object in the accusative.  See :ref:`Accusative case<case_accusative>` 
for more details.

Form
~~~~

The case of a noun, pronoun, adjective, or participle is indicated by the case ending (or suffix) attached to the end of the word.   
These changes follow three basic patterns called *"First declension"*, *"Second declension”*, and *“Third declension.”*

First declension nouns have a feminine gender for the most part and in the nominative singular end in an alpha or an eta.  
See `First Declension <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paradigms.html#first-declension>`_ .  A few masculine nouns end in an  -ας or –ης.  These words 
also follow a first declension pattern.

Second declension nouns end in –ος or –ον in the nominative singular.  Almost all words ending in –ος in the nominative singular are
masculine gender.  All words that end in –ον in the nominative singular are neuter gender.  
See `Second Declension <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paradigms.html#n-4-second-declension>`_ .

Third declension nouns have stems that end in a consonant or the vowels (ι, υ, ευ).  They are made up of all three genders. 
See `Third Declension <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paradigms.html#third-declension>`_ .

Adjectives and pronouns agree in gender with the noun they are modifying (or to which they are referring).  The form of the ending will
vary both by case and gender.  See `Adjective_paradigm <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paradigms.html#adjectives>`_  or  
`Pronoun_paradigm <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paradigms.html#pronouns>`_ .

Order of Words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the Greek language has a case system, the order of the words in a sentence can be changed to place an emphasis on a particular word
or clause.   The normal word order is **conjunction – verb – subject – object**.   When this order is changed there is probably a slight
emphasis being made on the words that are moved up.  

.. csv-table::  Example: Satan tempting Jesus

  Matthew 4:3
  Εἰ,υἱὸς,εἶ,τοῦ,θεοῦ,εἰπὲ,ἵνα,οἱ,λίθοι,οὗτοι,ἄρτοι,γένωνται.
  Ei,huios,ei,tou,theou,eipe,hina,hoi,lithoi,houtoi,artoi,genōntai.
  If,son,you are,of,god,order,that,the,stones,these,bread,they become.

**If you are the son of god**, *order that these stones become bread.*

Note:  In this sentence the phrase “if you are the son of god” has been moved to the first position in the sentence.   The movement of the
phrase to the front of the sentence places a slight emphasis or stress on the condition.
