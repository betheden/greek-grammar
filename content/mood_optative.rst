Mood optative
=============

Glossary
--------

The **optative mood** indicates that the speaker is referring to the
verbal action as a contingent possibility (even less assured than the
subjunctive mood) (e.g., *he might eat*).

Μηκέτι ἐκ σοῦ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα μηδεὶς καρπὸν **φάγοι**. (Mrk 11:14)

**May** no one ever again **eat** fruit from you!
