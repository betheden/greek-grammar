# comparative Glossary

Adjectives can have three degrees, called *positive* (e.g., *good*), **comparative** (e.g., *better*) and *superlative* (e.g., *best*).

**Better** is in the **comparative degree** since it is making a comparison between two things.

ὁ παλαιὸς **χρηστός** ἐστιν (Luk 5:39)
	
the old is **better**
