# verb_contracted_form Glossary

The **contracted form** of a **verb** occurs when the vowel of the verb stem combines with the vowel of the personal endings to form a new vowel or diphthong. (Dictionaries list verbs in their uncontracted forms [e.g., φιλέω, *love*] as the entry headword, but they always occur in the NT and all Greek sentences in their *contracted forms* [φιλῶ, *I love*, or *I am loving*]).
