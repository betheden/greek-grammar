Verb intransitive
=================

Glossary
--------

Intransitive verbs are verbs that do not have a direct object. Therefore
verbs that take their object in the predicate nominative are
intransitive. Most verbs in the passive tense will be intransitive.
(There are a few exceptions). [ example: I **stand**. My name **is**
Joe. "stand" and "is" are intransitive.]

    where the christ  **to be born**  

    Where is the Christ **to be born**?

The passive verb **γεννᾶται** is intransitive.
