# mood_indicative Glossary

The **indicative mood** indicates that the speaker assumes that the verbal action he is referring to is real (rather than only potential) (e.g., *he is eating*). It is the *default* mood when there is no reason to use one of the other moods.

μετὰ τῶν τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν **ἐσθίει** (Mrk 2:16)

**he is eating** with tax collectors and sinners
