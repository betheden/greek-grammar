# tense_perfect Glossary
**Perfect** is the verb **tense-form** a speaker can use to describe an action which either describes a present state (e.g., *you are forgiven*) or which took place in the past (e.g., *we have eaten*, *they have traveled*). It is often thought of as a completed action where the results continue on to the present.
