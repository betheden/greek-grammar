Summary
-------

Third person is used when the narrator or speaker refers to someone
besides himself or the listener (or reader).


Article
-------

The third person is the person or thing refered to other than the speaker or someone being addressed.  Pronouns in the third person
(*he*, *him*, *his*, *she*, *her*, or *it* or group of people/things *they*, *them*, or *their*, refer to something that is spoken about.

The third person can be used in both direct and indirect speech.

Third person references appear in both :ref:`Verb<verb>` forms, and :ref:`Pronoun_Personal<pronoun_personal>` forms.

Form
----

When a word is in the third person, it can be recognized by a variety of
changes to the form. These changes differ greatly from each other and
are hard to sum up in a simple, helpful way. These changes can be classified into Verbal Conjugation forms and Personal Pronouns.

The third person of a verb is formed by adding a third person personal ending (or sufformative) to the verb stem.  
These endings can be divided into eight basic types:  primary active, secondary active, primary middle/passive and 
secondary middle/passive.   There are also singular and plural endings.   The paradigm below shows a sample of the kinds of changes that
indicate a third person verbal form.

The third person can be found in
:ref:`verb<verb>`  forms, and as a :ref:`Pronoun_Personal<pronoun_personal>` forms.

Function
--------
  


In the :ref:`verb<verb>` form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As stated above a suffix is added to the verb stem to indicate the person and number for the subject of the verb.  The subject in a 
sentence is the person or thing that does the action of the verb.  However, if the verb is in the :ref:`passive voice<voice_passive>`_ ,
the subject of the sentence receives the action of the verb.

.. csv-table:: 

  John 1:14
  καὶ,ὁ,λόγος,σὰρξ,ἐγέν**ετο**,καὶ,ἐσκήνω**σεν**,ἐν,ἡμῖν
  kai,ho,logos,sarx,egen**eto**,kai,eskēnō**sen**,en,hemin
  and,the,word,flesh,**it** became,and,**it** lived,among,us


*The Word became flesh and lived among us.*


The personal ending of the verb is generally sufficient to show the person and number of the subject of the sentence.  
Therefore, an emphasis is being made when the nominative case of the personal pronoun is used in conjunction with the verb.

.. csv-table::

  Ephesians 4:11
  καὶ,**αὐτὸς**,ἔδωκεν,τοὺς,μὲν,,ἀποστόλους
  kai,**autos**,edōken,tous,men,,apostolous
  and,**he**,he gave,some,(to be),apostles
  
  
* **He** gave some to be apostles*


As a Personal Pronoun
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The third person :ref:`Personal Pronoun<pronoun_personal>`  can be used as a subject, an object, or to indicate possession.  
Personal pronouns may also be used as the object of a preposition.  The :ref:`number<number>` (singular or plural) and the :ref:`gender<gender>` (Masculine, feminine, 
or neuter) will agree with its antecedent.  However, the :ref:`case<case>`  will depend on its function in the sentence.


**Prepositions**
Third person personal pronouns can be the object of a preposition.  They therefore can occur in the Genitive, Dative, or Accusative case
depending upon the preposition.

**Subject of a sentence or clause** (including predicate nominative)
