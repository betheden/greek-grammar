# case Glossary

A **case** is a usage of a Greek nominal which is indicated by its morphology and shows its relationship to other words in a sentence (such as the subject). Greek has five cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative and vocative. (Some teachers divide the genitive into genitive and ablative, and divide the dative into dative, locative and instrumental, and thus use an eight-case system for Greek).
