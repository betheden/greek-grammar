Glossary
--------

An adjective is a part of speech which describes a noun or pronoun (or a word functioning as a noun or pronoun).

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Adjectives describe (or modify) a noun or a pronoun.  Adjectives function (or are used) in four distinct ways; 

  #.	Attributive – giving information about the noun. It tells of an attribute or a quality to the word it modifies.
  #.	Substantive – taking the place of a noun (or pronoun), acts like a noun
  #.	Predicate Nominative – asserting something about the subject of the sentence
  #.	Adverbial – used to modify (or give information) about a verb

Often the final determination as to how an adjective is being used (or its function in the sentence) must be based on context
after taking into account the form of the adjective.

Adjectives may also be used as a `comparative <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adjective.html#comparisons>`_ .


Form
~~~~

Greek adjectives must match the noun they modify in, :ref:`number<number>` , and :ref:`gender<gender>` .
Because of this, they can take the form of all three genders:  
:ref:`masculine<gender_masculine>` , :ref:`feminine<gender_feminine>` , and  :ref:`neuter<gender_neuter>` . 
If the adjective is functioning as an attributive, it will also agree with the noun it modifies in :ref:`case<case>` .
An adjective is listed in a lexicon in its nominative, singular, masculine form.

Adjectives will show these these various forms by using the same endings as nouns.
See Master Table 1 and Master Table 2 :ref:`Master Tables<paradigms>` .
(The set of suffixes used by each adjective is determined by its stem, 
just as is true with nouns.   See `adjective_paradigms <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paradigms.html#adjectives>`_ .


**Adjectives decline according to the stem of the adjective NOT THE STEM OF THE NOUN IT IS MODIFYING.**  In other words, 
the feminine dative singular for the adjective πάς will always be πάςῃ.  It will not change when modifying any other
dative feminine noun.

**Example:**  The final vowel (α) in the feminine declension for the adjective 
πάς, πάσα, πάν ( *all, each, every *) changes to an (η) in the dative singular.  
 See `Table_A7 <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paradigms.html#id6>`_
The first declension noun εὐλογία  does not undergo the same vowel change.
As long as the adjective agrees with its noun in number, and gender, 
the specific form of its endings makes no difference to translation.

  Ephesians 1:3
  ὁ,εὐλογήσας,ἡμᾶς,ἐν,**πάσῃ**,**εὐλογίᾳ**,**πνευματικῇ**
  ho,eulogēsas,hēmas,en,**pasē**,**eulogia**,**pneumatikē**
  who,has blessed,us,with,**every**,**blessing**,**spiritual**

*who has blessed us with*  **every spiritual blessing**

In this example the adjectives πάςῃ and πνευματικῇ are feminine singular and agree with the noun εὐλογιᾳ in gender and number.  
They also agree in case because they are functioning as an attributive adjective (see below).

Most first declension nouns are feminine (but some are masculine).   Most second declension
nouns are masculine (but some are feminine or neuter).   Third declension nouns may be masculine, feminine, or neuter.  


The entry in the lexicon will identify the gender of each noun.  However, if the definite article is present in the text,
the definite article always agrees with the noun it is modifying in case, number and gender.  The definite article (if present)
in the text may also serve as an indicator of the gender of the noun.  

The adjective (like the article) will always take the form that represents the true gender of the noun.   In the example 
below ποίμην may look like it is feminine because it ends with “ην”, but it is a third declension masculine noun.  An adjective 
modifying ποίμην must therefore decline in the masculine form. In this example both ποιμήν and καλός are nominative masculine singular.

*I am the* **good shepherd.**


Function
~~~~~~~~

Attributive function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the most common use of an adjective. If the adjective is giving more information about its noun,
it is functioning as an :ref:`ascriptive adjective<adjective_ascriptive>` . If it is identifying which 
noun the writer is speaking about, it is functioning as a :ref:`restrictive adjective<adjective_restrictive>` 
adjective. Attributive adjectives may come before or after the noun it modifies. They will usually have 
an article. Attributive adjectives must agree with the noun they modify in case, number, and gender. 
They will occur in one of several patterns.  One of the most common patterns is
**definite article- noun- definite article- adjective**.  
Attributive adjectives following this pattern are often restrictive.

  Καὶ,**τῇ**,**ἡμέρᾳ**,**τῇ**,**τρίτῃ**,γάμος,ἐγένετο
  Kai,**tē**,**hēmera**,**tē**,**trite**,gamos,egeneto
  And,**on the**,**day**,**the**,**third**,wedding, there was

*and there was a wedding on*  **the third day**
 

Another pattern for attributive adjectives is:  **definite article – adjective- noun**.

  Matthew 12:35
  ὁ,**ἀγαθὸς**,**ἄνθρωπος**,ἐκ,τοῦ,**ἀγαθοῦ**,**θησαυροῦ**
  ho,**agathos**,**anthrōpos**,ek,tou,**agathou**,**thēsaurou**
  the,**good**,**man**,out,of the,**good**,**treasure**

*The*  **good man** *from the* **good treasure..**

Attributive adjectives may also occur with no definite article.
The pattern for attributive adjectives without an article is generally:   **noun-adjective**

  not,a,**commandment**,**new**,I am writing,to you,but,an,**commandment**,**old**

*I am not writing a* **new commandment** *to you, but an* **old commandment...**

Note:  if there is NO article, the adjective could be functioning as a predicate nominative.
See  *Predicate Nominative* below.


Substantive Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, an adjective is used, but there is no noun nearby that it agrees
with in case, number,and gender.  There is therefore no noun that
it could be modifying.  When this occurs the adjective is functioning as a noun. 
In this case, the reader understands that the writer is referring to some unnamed person or
object in the sentence.  The unnamed person or object is simply identified by the adjective. 
An adjective functioning in this way is called a
**substantive** (because the substance of a noun is implied by the
adjective). A substantive adjective will **usually** have an article.

If an adjective is functioning as a **substantive** , its **case** will be
determined by its function within the clause.
Its **number** and **gender** will be determined by the person or object it represents.

  Romans 1:17
  καθὼς,γέγραπται,ὁ,δὲ,**δίκαιος**,,ἐκ,πίστεως,ζήσεται 
  kathōs,gegraptai,ho,de,**dikaios**,,ek,pisteōs,zēsetai
  as,it has been written,the,but,**righteous**,[man/person],from,faith,he will live

*as it has been written, "Indeed, the* **righteous** will live by faith."



**[ Note to Grant & Ken]  I have a real question about the English Unfolding Word Literal text’s literal translation of Romans 1:17.**
**I do not see any justification for translating “δε” as “indeed.”**
 https://door43.org/u/Door43-Catalog/en_ult/c36fb9d97a/46-ROM.html#045-ch-001

**NASB translates it a “but”  NIV, NKJV, ESV just omit the word.    The following is from BDAG δέ (Hom.+) one of the most common Gk.**
**particles, used to connect one clause to another, either to express contrast or simple continuation. When it is felt that there**
**is some contrast betw. clauses—though the contrast is oft. scarcely discernible—the most common translation is ‘but’. When a simple** 
**connective is desired, without contrast being clearly implied, ‘and’ will suffice, and in certain occurrences the marker may be left** 
**untranslated**

**If one compares this passage with Habakkuk 2:4 there is a mild contrast intended, this would justify the use of “but” as opposed to “and”.**
**However as per BDAG   simple omission of the conjunction is acceptable as well which was the path chosen by NIV,NKJV, and ESV.**     

**RECOMMENDATION** :  I am therefore recommending that we change the word “indeed” in the “smooth translation” to “but”  or simply omit 
**the translation of “δε” as was done by the NIV, etc.   It is kind of a toss up as to which path.  Personally, I lean to the “but” as I**
**think a contrast is intended based on Habakkuk and this is a quote.  ....      Your suggestions.**


Predicative Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an adjective does not have an article, but the modified noun does have an article, the adjective is 
probably functioning as a **predicate**.   Predicative adjectives are adjectives that describe nouns 
using a linking verb.  Often the linking verb is not present in the Greek text and must be supplied 
when translating in English. Predictive adjectives must agree with the noun they are modifying in *gender* 
and *number*.  Some languages need a verb in every sentence, so the understood verb may be added to the 
translation in order to make the sentence grammatically correct in the target language. 

Predicative adjectives **never** have the article preceding them.  The absence of the article is a big clue
that and adjective is a predicate adjective. However, a final determination must be based on context.   
If the noun has an article, and the adjective does not have an article, then the adjective is functioning as a predicative adjective.   
If there is no article before the noun or the adjective, the function of the adjective must be determined based on context.  
Predicative adjectives occur in three basic patterns.  

*The first pattern is:*   **adjective-definite article-noun**

.. csv-table::

  Matthew 5:3
  **Μακάριοι**,,οἱ,πτωχοὶ,τῷ,πνεύματι
  **makarioi**,,hoi,ptōchoi,tō,pneumati
  **Blessed**,**are**,the,poor,in the,spirit
 
**Blessed are**  *the poor in spirit*

*A second pattern is:*  **article-noun-adjective**

.. csv-table::

  John 3:33
  ὁ,θεὸς,**ἀληθής**,ἐστιν
  ho,Theos,**alēthēs**,estin
  the,God,**true**,he is

*God is* **true**

**A third pattern occurs when no article is present**

.. csv-table::

  James 1:12
  **Μακάριος**,,ἀνὴρ,ὃς,ὑπομένει,πειρασμόν
  **makarios**,,anēr,hos,hypomenei,peirasmon
  **Blessed**,is the,man,who,he endures,a trial

**Blessed** *is the man who endures testing.*

Adverbial Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some adjectives can be used as an adverb.  In this case the adjective is usually be in the neuter gender and accusative (or dative) case.
The most common adjectives used as an adverb are:  βραχύ (short), ἲδιον (one's own), μίκρον (small), ὀλίγον (little),
μόνον (alone), πολύ (many), πρῶτον (first), ὕστερον (second).

.. csv-table::

  Matthew 6:33
  ζητεῖτε,δὲ,**πρῶτον**,τὴν,βασιλείαν
  zēteite,de,**proton**,tēn,basileian 
  you seek,but,**first**,the,kingdom

*But seek* **first** *his kingdom*


Comparisons
^^^^^^^^^^^

Adjectives may be used to make a comparison between two nouns. 
  •	The *positive degree* of an adjective makes a simple assertion about the kind or quality of an object.
  •	The *comparative degree* asserts that the person or thing described by it has this quality in a higher degree than some other person or thing.
  •	The *superlative degree* asserts that the person or thing described by it as the highest degree or more of this quality that all the others in a group of items.

**Comparative degree form**

When an adjective is used to compare its noun to another noun, it is functioning
as a **comparative** adjective. Comparatives are formed by adding -τερος
(masc.), -τερα (fem.), or -τερον (neut.) to the end of the adjective.
(Some irregular adjectives take the suffixes -(ι)ων or -ον instead.)

**Caution:** 
  •	Some adjectives use the *positive form* to indicate a comparative degree.  
  •	Some adjectives use a *comparative form* to indicate a superlative degree.  
*Therefore the translator must be observant of the context and take the context into account when translating the text.*


.. csv-table::

  John 13:16
  οὐκ,ἔστιν,δοῦλος,**μείζων**,τοῦ,κυρίου,αὐτοῦ
  ouk,estin,doulos,**meizōn**,tou,kyriou,autou
  not, he is,a slave,**greater**,than,master,his

*a servant is not* **greater** *than his master*    

**Superlative degree form**


An adjective that compares a noun to two or more other nouns is a **superlative**
adjective. The suffixes that show the superlative form are:
*-τατος* (masculine), *-τατη* (feminine), and *-τατον* (neuter), or
*-ιστος* (masculine), *-ιστη* (feminine), and *-ιστον* (neuter).

Caution:

  •	Sometimes adjectives use the *comparative form*  of an adjective to express a superlative quality.  
  •	At other times the *superlative form* form may be used to simply make a comparison

  egō,gar,eimi,ho,**elachistos**,tōn,apostolōn
  I,for,I am,the,**least**,of the,apostles

*For I am the* **least** *of the apostles.*



Elative
^^^^^^^

Both comparative and superlative adjectives may be used with an *elative* sense.  
When an adjective is used as an *elative* the quality expressed by the adjective is intensified, but no comparison is intended.
