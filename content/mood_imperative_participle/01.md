# mood_imperative_participle Glossary

A **participle** can sometimes be used to express a *command*. This usage is quite rare and some grammarians even debate whether it actually occurs in the NT.

**ἀποστυγοῦντες** τὸ πονηρόν, **κολλώμενοι** τῷ ἀγαθῷ· (Rom 12:9)

**abhor** what is evil, **cling** to what is good
