A **relative pronoun** refers back to another nominal as it's antecedent
and introduces a relative clause. *Who*, *whom*,\ *what* and *which* are
common relative pronouns.

ἐπίστευσαν τῇ γραφῇ καὶ τῷ λόγῳ **ὃν** εἶπεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς. (Jhn 2:22)

A **relative pronoun** always agrees with its antecedent in *gender* and
*number*, but not in *case*. The *case* is determined by its function in
the relative clause (see ###advanced).

A *relative pronoun* sometimes takes on the same case as its antecedent,
1) when it is in close proximity to its antecendent and 2) when the
*relative pronoun* would normally be *accusative* but has been changed
to match a *genitive* or *dative* antecedent.

ὑμεῖς ἐστὲ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν καὶ τῆς διαθήκης **ἧς** ὁ θεὸς διέθετο
πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν (Act 3:25)

you are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant **which** God gave
to our fathers

In this verse, the **relative pronoun ἧς** *(of which)* is genitive, to
match its antecedent, *τῆς διαθήκης (of the covenant)*, though it should
be accusative ἥν *(which)* since it is the direct object of the verb
(*διέθετο*, *[God] gave*).

function in the relative clause which may be

clause: *\ accusative\ * 1. subject of the relative clause:
