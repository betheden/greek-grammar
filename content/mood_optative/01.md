# mood_optative Glossary

The **optative mood** indicates that the speaker is referring to the verbal action as a contingent possibility (even less assured than the subjunctive mood) (e.g., *he might eat*).

Μηκέτι ἐκ σοῦ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα μηδεὶς καρπὸν **φάγοι**. (Mrk 11:14)

**May** no one ever again **eat** fruit from you!
