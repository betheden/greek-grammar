# pronoun_reciprocal Article
A **reciprocal pronoun** indicates that two or more people are interacting with one another, both doing and receiving the action. In the NT, there is only one **reciprocal pronoun**, ἀλλήλων. It  is always in the plural, and only in the accusative, genitive or dative. It never appears in the nominative or singular, so the lemma is the genitive plural.

καὶ ἔλεγον πρὸς **ἀλλήλους** (Mrk 4:41)

and they said **to one another**
