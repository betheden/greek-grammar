Case accusative
===============

Glossary              
--------

**Accusative** is the case used to indicate the object of a verb and of some prepositions.  
It also is used to indicate the subject of infinitives.

.. csv-table::  Example Mark 1:3 

  ἑτοιμάσατε,τὴν,**ὁδὸν**,Κυρίου 
  hetoimasate,tēn,**hodon**,Kyriou
  prepare,the,**way**,of the Lord

*make ready the* **way** *of the Lord*



Article               
-------

The accusative case is sometimes referred to as the case of “limitation.”  
It limits the verb as to extent, direction, or end (the goal) of an action.  
The principle uses of the accusative case are to:

  #.	Indicate the direct object of a verb  [see `Accusative_Direct_Object <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_accusative.html#id2>`_ ] 
  #.	Indicate the object of certain prepositions [See `Object_of_Prepositions <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_accusative.html#object-of-certain-prepositions>`_ ] 
  #.	Indicate the subject of an infinitive [See `Subject_of_Infinitive <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_accusative.html#subject-of-infinitives>`_ ] 
  #.	Adverbial accusative [See `Adverbial_Accusative <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_accusative.html#id5>`_ ]

The Accusative case is formed by adding the accusative case ending to the stem of a word (often with a connecting vowel).

Accusative_Direct Object
########################

The accusative case is used to indicate the direct object of the transitive verb.  
A direct object is the person(s) or thing(s) which receive the action of transitive verbs.  Because most verbs are transitive almost every 
sentence will have the object of the verb in the accusative case. 
However, there are a few verbs that can take their object in the Genitive Case [see `Genitive Case <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_genitive.html#id3>`_ ] 
or `Dative_Direct_Object <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_dative.html#id3>`_ .]  


.. csv-table::   Example: John 3:16

  οὕτως,γὰρ,ἠγάπησεν,ὁ,Θεὸς,τὸν,**κόσμον**
  houtōs,gar,ēgapēsen,ho,Theos,ton,**kosmon**
  thus/so,for,he loved,the,God,the,**world**

*For God so loved the* **world**

.. csv-table:: Example:  Matthew 11:10

  ἀποστέλλω,τὸν,**ἄγγελόν**,μου
  apostellō,ton,**angelon**,mou
  I am sending,the,**messenger**,my

*I am sending my* **messenger**


Double Accusative
#################

Some verbs may require two or more objects to complete their meaning. 
These verbs will require two or more objects, a person (or persons)
and/or a thing (or things)in the accusative case to complete their thought.  In this case, the translator may wish to use an implied preposition
in their translation in order to make a smoother translation.


.. csv-table::  Matthew 1:21

  καὶ,καλέσεις,τὸ,**ὄνομα**,αὐτοῦ,**Ἰησοῦν**
  kai,kaleseis,to,**onoma**,autou,**Iēsoun**
  and,you will call,the,**name**,of him,**Jesus**

*and you will call his*  **name Jesus**
  [In this instance the two objects are *ὄνομα* and  *Ἰησοῦν*]   


.. csv-table::  Example: John 14:26

  ἐκεῖνος,**ὑμᾶς**,διδάξει,**πάντα**
  ekeinos,**hymas**,didaxei,**panta**
  That one,**you**,he will teach,**all things**

*he will teach* **you everything**  
[This could be translated with the implied preposition; “ He will teach **to you** everything.”  


Another example of a double accusative is the accusative that is used with an oath.
The preposition “by” may be used to assist in the translation.

.. csv-table::  Example: Mark 5:7

  ὁρκίζω,σε,τὸν,**Θεόν**,μή,με,βασανίσῃς
  horkizō,se,ton,**Theon**,mē,me,basanisēs
  I implore/beg,you,by,**God**,not,me,torment

*I beg you* **by God**, *do not torment me*

Note:  In this example, **σε** and **με** are Accusative Direct Objects.



Object of Certain Prepositions
##############################

Certain prepositions take their object in the accusative case such as **είς**, **δία**, **πρός**, and **ὑπό**.
**Caution:** Use the lexicon to determine the meaning of a preposition when it is followed 
by a word in a particular case. 

Often the meaning of the preposition is specific first to the preposition itself
and then to the case of the noun it is used with. Therefore, the basic meaning of 
the case cannot be trusted to arrive at a proper understanding of the meaning of the preposistion and a 
lexicon must be consulted.  In some cases the meaning of the preposition will conform 
to the basic meaning of the case such as ἀπό with the Genitive case (from, out from) 
but in other cases such as when ὑπό is used with the accusative case it has the basic 
meaning of “below” or “under” and when used with the genitive case AND AN ACTIVE VERB
ὑπό has the basic meaning of “with” or “by” .  

Therefore, a lexicon must be consulted to arrive at the meaning of the preposition.  [See - :ref:`Preposition<preposition>` _.]

Subject of Infinitives
######################

The subject of an infinitive may also be the subject of the sentence. If this is the case, the subject of the sentence
(and of the infinitive) will be in the nominative case. If the subject of the infinitive is not the subject of the sentence,
it will almost always be in the accusative case.   Therefore, the accusative case is considered to be the case for the subject
of an infinitive.

Infinitives can have both a subject and an object.  If this is the case both will be in the accusative case.   
In this instance, usually word order and context will clarify which word is the subject and which is the object of the infinitive.  

If there are two words in the accusative case, and context by itself does make clear 
(1) which word is the subject of the infinitive, and (2) which word is the object of the infinitive, 
then the reader may use the following rule as a helpful guideline.  

  If one of the two words is a pronoun, proper name, or has the definite article, then it will probably be the subject.

This same basic principle may also be used to help identify the subject from the predicate nominative.  [see `Nominative-Predicate <https://ugg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/case_nominative.html#nominative-predicate>`_ ].  


.. csv-table:: Example: John 1:12

  ἔδωκεν,αὐτοῖς,ἐξουσίαν,**τέκνα**,Θεοῦ,γενέσθαι
  edōken,autois,exousian,**tekna**,Theou,genesthai
  He gave,to them,authority,**children**,of God,to be

*he gave them the right to become* **children** *of God.*
[Note:  The subject of the verb γενέσθαι is τέκνα.]

In the following example a single word serves as the object of a participle and at the same time as the subject of the infinitive.
με serves as the object of the participle clause  ὁ πέμψας με , and at the same time serves as the subject of the infinitive βαπτίζειν.

.. csv-table:: Example: John 1:33

  ὁ,πέμψας,**με**,βαπτίζειν,ἐν,ὕδατι
  ho,pempsas,**me**,baptizein,en,hydati
  he,who sent,**me**,to baptize,in,water

*he who sent* **me** *to baptize in water*

.. csv-table:: Example: Luke 9:2 

  καὶ,ἀπέστειλεν,**αὐτοὺς**,κηρύσσειν,τὴν,Βασιλείαν,τοῦ,Θεοῦ
  kai,apesteilen,**autous**,kēryssein,tēn,Basileian,tou,Theou
  and,he sent,**them**,to preach,the,kingdom,of,God

*he sent* **them** *out to proclaim the kingdom of God*
[Note: αὐτοὺς is the subject of the infinitive (*κηρύσσειν*) and the accusative-direct object for the verb *ἀπέστειλεν*. Note also that
τὴν Βασιλείαν is the object of the infinitive (*κηρύσσειν*).]


.. csv-table:: Example: John 5:18

  μᾶλλον,ἐζήτουν,αὐτὸν,οἱ,**Ἰουδαῖοι**,ἀποκτεῖναι
  mallon,ezētoun,auton,hoi,**Ioudaioi**,apokteinai
  even more,they were seeking,him,the,**Jews**,to kill


*the* **Jews** *sought even more to kill him*

[Note: οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι is the subject of the sentence and serves at the subject of the infinitive. 
It is  in the nominative case because it is the subject of the sentence.]


Adverbial Accusative
####################

An Adverbial Accusative occurs when an adjective or number in the accusative case is used to quantify (or limit) the action of a verb. 
Some words such as **μᾶλλον** and **σχεδόν** have become adverbs because of their exclusive use in this manner.
An adverbial accusative may be used to express a limitation by indicating:

  *	the measure or distance of an action (How long? or How far?)
  *	the time of an action 
  *	the manner of an action 
  *	to indicate a reference point for the action.


.. csv-table:: Example: Mark 12:34  **Adverbial Accusative of Measure**

  εἶπεν,αὐτῷ,οὐ,**μακρὰν**,εἶ,ἀπὸ,τῆς,Βασιλείας,τοῦ,Θεοῦ
  eipen,autō,ou,**makran**,ei,apo,tēs,Basileias,tou,Theou
  he said,to him,not,**far**,you are,from,the,Kingdom,of,God

*he said to him, “You are not* **far** *from the kingdom of God.”*

.. csv-table:: Example: Matthew 20:6  **Adverbial Accusative of time**

  τί,ὧδε,ἑστήκατε,**ὅλην**,τὴν,ἡμέραν,ἀργοί?
  ti,hōde,hestēkate,**holēn**,tēn,hēmeran,argoi?
  Why,here,are you standing,**whole**,the,day,idle?

*‘Why do you stand here idle* **all** *the day long?’*

.. csv-table:: Example: Matt 10:8  **Adverbial Accusative of Manner**   

  δωρεὰν,ἐλάβετε,**δωρεὰν**,δότε
  dōrean,elabete,**dōrean**,dote
  freely,you received,**freely**,you give

*Freely you have received,* **freely** *give.*

.. csv-table:: Example:  Romans 10:5   **Adverbial Accusative of Reference**

  Μωϋσῆς,γὰρ,γράφει,τὴν,**δικαιοσύνην**,τὴν,ἐκ,νόμου
  Mōusēs,gar,graphei,tēn,**dikaiosynēn**,tēn,ek,nomou
  Moses,for,he writes,the,**with reference to righteousness**,the,from,law

*For Moses writes* **about the righteousness** *that comes from the law:*
