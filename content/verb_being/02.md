Verbs of being indicate a stative relationship between the subject and the predicate: the subject (1) possesses a certain characteristic, or (2) is identical with the predicate. A nominal predicate of a verb of being will typically be in the nominative case. Examples of verbs of being include εἰμί (*I am*), γίνομαι (*I become*), and ὑπάρχω (*I am*).
