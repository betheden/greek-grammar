Comparative
===========

Glossary
--------

Adjectives can have three degrees, called *positive* (e.g., *good*),
**comparative** (e.g., *better*) and *superlative* (e.g., *best*).

**Better** is in the \*\* degree\*\* since it is making a comparison
between two things.

  ὁ παλαιὸς χρηστός ἐστιν
  ho palaios chrēstos estin
  the old better it is
  the old is better
