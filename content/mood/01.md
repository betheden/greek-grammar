# mood Glossary
**Mood** is a feature of the verb which indicates the speaker's viewpoint of the verbal action in relation to reality. Greek has four **moods**: *indicative*, *imperative*, *subjunctive*, and *optative*. 

The two remaining verb forms, the *infinitive* and the *participle*, technically do not have mood, but are often discussed alongside mood in Greek grammars.
