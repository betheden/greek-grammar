# determiner_article 
Determiners are words that identify or quantify a noun.   The definite article quantifies the noun by making it distinct from others of its kind.  The object of the article is definite whenever the article is used.     [e.g. *the* book as opposed to any book].  The absence of the definite article stresses the basic quality or character of the object as opposed to any particular object.  .  The object may still be definite even though the definite article is absence.

* Matthew 1:2
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Ἀβραὰμ  ἐγέννησεν  <b>τὸν</b>  Ἰσαάκ  Ἰσαὰκ  δὲ  ἐγέννησεν  <b>τὸν</b>  Ἰακώβ</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Abraam  egennēsen  <b>ton</b>  Isaak  Isaak  de  egennēsen  <b>ton</b>  Iakōb</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Abraham  became parent of <b>the</b> Issac, Isaac and  became parent of  <b>the</b> Jacob</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob</td>
</tr>

[Note: In this example the definite article before the names Isaac and Jacob are omitted in the smooth translation as the name of an individual is already definite in English.]
