Case nominative
===============

Glossary
--------

Nominative is the case used to identify the subject. Because verbs include the subject, the nominative case is used in apposition 
(or placed next) to the subject of the verb to add further identification.   The nominative case is also used as a predicate nominative to 
**equate or describe** the subject when used with a linking verb. The **nominative** is normally the form listed as the
headword in a dictionary entry (as the lemma).

The nominative case is the case of designation or identity. It is used to:

  #.	identify, designate or name the subject of the sentence,
  #.	used in apposition to the subject of the sentence or another noun,
  #.	used as a predicate nominative, or
  #.	may stand alone without a verb for emphasis.


Form
^^^^

The Nominative case is formed by adding the nominative case ending to the stem of a word (often with a connecting vowel).

Nominative - Subject
	
Nominative-Subject
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary use of the nominative case is to identify the subject of the sentence. The definite article will also be in the nominative 
case when it is modifying the subject of the sentence as can be seen in the example below.

.. csv-table:: 

  John 3:35 
  **ὁ**,**πατὴρ**,ἀγαπᾷ,τὸν,υἱόν
  **ho**,**patēr**,agapa,ton,huion
  **the**,**father**,he loves,the,son

**The father** *loves the son.*

The reader will notice that the verb includes the subject of the sentence “he” as part of a first person singular verb.  **ὁ πατὴρ** 
identifies the subject by pointing specifically to the father.  Therefore the nominative-subject also stands in *apposition* (or next to)
the subject that is included as a part of the verb, but helps to clarify the subject of the verb with the additional information.

The **nominative case** is also used for *adjectives* and *participles* modifying the subject.  This is because adjectives and participles 
use the same case of the noun they are modifying.  (They also have the same :ref:`gender<gender>` and :ref:`number<number>` as the word 
they are modifying)  See :ref:`Adjectives<adjective>` .   



Example – adjective and noun are both in the nominative case.

.. csv-table::

  John 10:11
  ὁ,ποιμὴν,**ὁ**,**καλὸς**,τὴν,ψυχὴν,αὐτοῦ,τίθησιν,ὑπὲρ,τῶν,προβάτων
  ho,poimēn,**ho**,**kalos**,tēn,psychēn,autou,tithēsin,hyper,tōn,probatōn
  the,shepherd,**the**,**good**,the,life,of him,he lays down,in behalf of,the,sheep

**The good** *shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.*

Example – participle and noun being modified are both in the nominative case. (Like adjectives, participles agree with the noun they 
modify in case, number, and gender). See :ref:`Participles<participle>` .

.. csv-table::

  Matthew 6:6
  ὁ,πατήρ,σου,**ὁ**,**βλέπων**,ἐν,τῷ,κρυπτῷ,ἀποδώσει,σοι.
  ho,patēr,sou,**ho**,**blepōn**,en,tō,kryptō,apodōsei,soi.
  the,father,of you,**who**,**is seeing**,in,the,secret,he will reward,to you

*your Father* **who sees** *in secret will reward you*

If an adjective or participle is serving as the subject of the sentence, they will be in the nominative case.

.. csv-table::

  Romans 1:17
  ὁ,δὲ,**δίκαιος**,ἐκ,πίστεως,ζήσεται.
  ho,de,**dikaios**,ek,pisteōs,zēsetai.
  the,indeed,**righteous**,by,faith,he will live.

*Indeed, the* **righteous** *will live by faith.*


Nominative – Apposition	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apposition means “*next to*” or “*beside*.”  Sometimes a second noun is placed next to the subject of the sentence (or clause) to add 
additional clarity.  This is the nominative of Apposition. The **nominative-Apposition** sometimes will modify the subject of the sentence, 
or it may modify a noun that is not the subject and is not in the nominative case.  However, the Nominative-Apposition will still be in 
the nominative case because it is **identifying or designating the noun**. In the example below  *ὁ μάρτυς* and *ὁ προτότοκος* are both in 
the nominative case and are in apposition to Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ which is in the genitive case. 

Example:

.. csv-table::

  Revelation 1:5
  καὶ,ἀπὸ,Ἰησοῦ,Χριστοῦ,**ὁ**,**μάρτυς**,ὁ,πιστός,**ὁ**,**πρωτότοκος**,τῶν,νεκρῶν...
  kai,apo,Iēsou,Christou,**ho**,**martys**,ho,pistos,**ho**,**prōtotokos**,tōn,nekrōn...
  and,from,Jesus,Christ,the,**witness**,the,faithful,the,**firstborn**,from the,dead

*and from Jesus Christ, the faithful* **witness**, *the* **firstborn** *from the dead...*


Nominative-Predicate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linking verbs such as **εἰμί, γίνομαι, and ὑπάρχω** are completed with an object in nominative case.  The **Nominative-Predicate** 
(also referred to as Predicate nominative) construction can take different forms but consists of a **subject + a linking verb +**
**an object in the nominative case.**   [The linking verb may be implied and not actually present in the text.]  Care must be used in 
the translation of a *Nominative-Predicate* because the object may not be in the last position and is often not an exact equivalent of 
the subject.   The predicate nominative is generally the larger class of objects, while the subject is the smaller class.  Therefore, the 
translator must clearly understand which word (or phrase) is the subject of the sentence and which word (or phrase) is the predicate 
nominative and the translator must use equal care in the translation so that the reader will be able to distinguish between the subject 
and the predicate nominative.
  
  Consider the sentence, “Paul is a man.”   “Paul” is the subject and “man” is the Nominative-predicate.   The translator must be careful 
  to first understand the passage and then take equal care in the translation to make sure the reader understands that Paul is the subject
  and man is the Nominative-predicate.  English uses word order to indicate which word is the subject and which word is the predicate 
  nominative. Therefore reversing   the word order in English to say “a man is Paul” would lead to the reader to think that all men are 
  “Paul” which is not true.   The more   definite of the two words (or clauses) in the nominative case will be the subject of the sentence. 

Greek, for the most part, does not use position to distinguish between subject and the predicate nominative.  In Greek the predicate
nominative may be moved in front of the subject to place an emphasis on the predicate nominative. 

**The following basic rules will help to clarify which word (or clause) is the subject of the sentence and which word (or clause)**
**is the predicate nominative for the sentence in Koine Greek.**  

NOTE: In Koine Greek, the linking verb may be omitted entirely, and may have to be supplied by the reader (or translator) to complete 
the sentence. (an example of this will be given below.)

As stated above, the more definite of the two nominatives will be the subject of the sentence.  Therefore...

1)	if only one of the words in the nominative case is a pronoun, then the pronoun will be the subject.  The pronoun may be included as a part of the verb.

.. csv-table::

  Matthew 5:14
  **ὑμεῖς**,ἐστε,τὸ,φῶς,τοῦ,κόσμου.
  **hymeis**,este,to,phōs,tou,kosmou.
  **you**,you are,the,light,of the,world.

**You** *are the light of the world.*

When Jesus spoke to the crowd and said “you”, they had a clear understanding of who the “you” was referring to.  It was referring to them. 
“You” is the subject.  “The light” is the predicate nominative.

.. csv-table::

  Matthew 14:33
  ἀληθῶς,θεοῦ,υἱὸς,**εἶ**
  alēthōs,theou,huios,**ei**
  truly,of god,son,**you** are

*Truly* **you** *are the Son of God.*

In this sentence, the subject “you” is included in the verb εἶ.  υἱὸς is the predicate nominative.  
	
2)	If only one of the words in the nominative case is preceded with the article, the word with the article is the subject.

.. csv-table::

  John 1:1
  καὶ,θεὸς,ἦν,ὁ,**λόγος**
  kai,theos,ēn,ho,**logos**
  and,god,was,the,**word**

*and the* **Word** *was God*

.. csv-table::

  John 1:14
  καὶ,ὁ,**λόγος**,σὰρξ,ἐγένετο
  kai,ho,**logos**,sarx,egeneto
  and,the,**word**,flesh,it became

*The* **Word** *became flesh*

3)	If only one of the words in the nominative case is a proper name, the proper name will be the subject.

.. csv-table::

  James 5:17
  **Ἠλείας**,ἄνθρωπος,ἦν,ὁμοιοπαθὴς,ἡμῖν
  **Ēleias**,anthrōpos,ēn,homoiopathēs,hemin
  **Elijah**,a man,he was,like/or with a nature like,us

**Elijah** *was a man just like us.*

Notice that in this example both the Subject (ἠλείας) and the predicate nominative (ἂνθρςπος) come before the verb.

4)	If one of the nouns in the nominative case is a pronoun and one is a proper name, the pronoun will be the subject and the proper name 
will be the predicate nominative.

.. csv-table::

  Matthew 16:20
  **αὐτός**,ἐστιν,ὁ,Χριστός
  **autos**,estin,ho, Christos
  **he**,he is,the Christ

**He** *is the Christ.*

.. csv-table::

  Matthew 11:14
  **αὐτός**,ἐστιν,Ἠλείας
  **autos**,estin,Ēleias
  **he**,he is,Elijah

**He** *is Elijah*

5)	If 
  a.	both have the article or 
  b.	both are proper names or 
  c.	one has the article and the other is a proper name, 

    ...then the one that comes first is the subject.

John 15:1
ὁ πατήρ μου ὁ γεωργός ἐστιν.
ho patēr mou ho geōrgos estin
the father my the farmer/gardener he is

My father is the gardener

6)	Some times εις + accusative is used for the predicate nominative.  This may occur with γίνομαι, εἰμί, or λογίζομαι. This portrays a process of something “changing into” something else.  In English, it is translated with a predicate nominative and the εἰς is not translated.

Mark 10:8
καὶ ἔσονται οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν
kai esontai hoi dyo eis sarka mian
and they will be the two,, flesh one 

and the two will become one flesh
	

Nominative–Stand_alone

A word or clause may appear in the nominative case without a verb or a direct object.  This may occur in the greeting of a letter, titles, headings, or to make something a heading by giving it special emphasis.  A word or clause may also appear in the nominative case to express the emotion of the writer.   In these cases, there is no intent of the writer to form a complete sentence.

For example see the greeting of the book of Jude.

Jude 1
Ἰούδας Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ δοῦλος, ἀδελφὸς δὲ Ἰακώβου
Ioudas Iēsou Christou doulos, adelphos de Iakōbou
Jude     of Jesus of Christ a slave  brother and of James

Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James


In Romans 11:33, Paul cries out with emotion

Romans 11:33
ὦ βάθος πλούτου, καὶ σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως Θεοῦ
ō bathos ploutou, kai sophias kai gnōseōs Theou
Oh depth of riches both of wisdom and of knowledge of God

Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
