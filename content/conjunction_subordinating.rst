Conjunction subordinating
=========================

Glossary
--------

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that combines an
independent clause with a dependent clause. A dependent clause cannot
stand on its own. [example: The boy received a present **because** it
was his birthday.] Typical subordinating conjunctions are **since**,
**because**, **before**, and **until**.

  "ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ὅτι νουνεχῶς ἀπεκρίθη εἶπεν αὐτῷ οὐ μακρὰν εἶ ἀπὸ
     τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ"
  "ho Iēsous idōn auton hoti nounechōs apekrithē eipen autō ou makran ei
     apo tēs Basileias tou Theou"
  "The Jesus when he saw that wisely he had answered he said to him not
     far you are from the kingdom of God"
  "When Jesus saw that he had given a wise answer, he said to him, ""You
     are not far from the kingdom of God."""
