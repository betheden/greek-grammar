Glossary
--------

A **case** is a usage of a Greek nominal which is indicated by its
morphology and shows its relationship to other words in a sentence (such
as the subject). Greek has five cases: nominative, genitive, dative,
accusative and vocative. (Some teachers divide the genitive into
genitive and ablative, and divide the dative into dative, locative and
instrumental, and thus use an eight- system for Greek).
